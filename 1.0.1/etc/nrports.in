# @sysconfdir@/ax25/nrports
#
# Nrports is an ASCII file that contains information about each 
# of the NET/ROM ports that are to be used. When dealing with an 
# NET/ROM utility such as call, it takes an optional argument that 
# is the port name. 
#
# This port name is a reference to the line within nrports, which 
# has the same name. It is the name that is used by nrattach to 
# create the actual netrom port.
#
# The callsign that which NET/ROM traffic from this port will use. 
# Note, this is not that address that users should connect to to get 
# access to a node style interface. This callsign/ssid should be 
# unique and should not appear elsewhere in either of the 
# @sysconfdir@/ax25/axports or the @sysconfdir@/ax25/nrports files.
#
# You also need to configure @sysconfdir@/ax25/nrbroadcast for NET/ROM to work.
#
# The example:
# netrom	N0ONE-7		LNODE	235	Net/ROM Switch Port
# creates a NET/ROM port known to the rest of the network as:
# LNODE:N0ONE-7
#
# Note that if you put a # in front of the alias name, that node will 
# not appear in the standard node lists at remote sites.
#
# The format of this file is:
#
# name 	callsign 	alias 	paclen 	description
netrom	N0ONE-7		LNODE	235	Net/ROM Switch Port

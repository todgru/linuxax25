libax25 for Debian
------------------

This package will conflicts with some files found in libc6-dev. The offending 
files are:
	netax25/ax25.h
	netrose/rose.h
	netrom/netrom.h

Those files belong to libax25, and as such, this package is marked to replace 
them. Those files will be overwritten by the ones found in the libax25-dev 
package.

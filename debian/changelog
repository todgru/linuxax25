libax25 (1.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added versioning to the shared libs to differentiate the ones generated
    by this source.
  * Revert a patch from the linux-ax25.org source to axutils.c (version 1.5) 
    that changed the behaviour of the ax25_ntoa function (breaking it). aton 
    should only convert the callsign, not modify it. Specifically, if the 
    callsign has a -0 SSID, DON'T DROP IT! This breaks existing software that 
    does use -0! If some program doesn't like SSID -0, then IT should be 
    modified to drop it or do whatever you want. The AX.25 spec says callsigns 
    MUST have an SSID from 0-15. The ax25_ntoa function strictly should 
    perform the conversion to ascii, and that is it.

libax25 (1.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release.
  * This version is a modified version of the January 2011 CVS source
    from http://www.linux-ax25.org/wiki/Main_Page
  * The forked code is now available from http://linuxax25.googlecode.com
  * This is a custom release, not associated with the official source.
  * This library has been beta for so long, it is time to release version 1.0.0.
  * Added missing compile flag for ax25io (-lz) in the ax25io/Makefile.am.
    Note that it HAS to be in the form libax25io_la_LIBADD for it to be
    picked up properly (found this out trying to make the Debian package).
  * Removed etc files (moved them to ax25-tools where they belong
  * Removed associated man pages to ax25-tools
  * Made the libax25.spec file get processed by configure properly
  * Reverted a couple of Bernard's patches in axutils.c back to what was
    in CVS per discussions with Thomas Osterried
  * Updated configure scripts for automake 1.10.1 and autoconf 2.61
  * Fixed configure.ac to do a proper check for zlib.h (to build ax25io)
    and abort the configure if zlib is not found
  * Cleaned up the Makefile.am
  * Moved source files out of the root folder and in to /lib, /man, and /etc
  * Added patch from Bernard Pidoux <f6bvp@free.fr> to axutils.c

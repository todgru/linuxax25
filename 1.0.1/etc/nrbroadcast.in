# @sysconfdir@/ax25/nrbroadcast
# This file may contain a number of entries. There would normally be 
# one entry for each AX.25 port that you wish to allow NET/ROM traffic on.
#
# Axport is the name of the port from axports which you want to carry 
# NET/ROM traffic on. If you do not have an entry in /etc/ax25/nrbroadcasts 
# for a port, then this means that no NET/ROM routing will occur and any 
# received NET/ROM broadcasts will be ignored for that port.
#
# Min_obs is the minimum obsolecence value for the port.
#
# Def_qual is the default quality of an incoming routing broadcast from 
# an unknown neighbour. 
#
# Worst_qual is the worst quality node received from a routing broadcast that 
# will be added to our routing table. Any routes under this quality will be 
# ignored.
#
# Verbose is a flag that determine if full NET/ROM routing broadcasts (1) 
# will be sent on this port, or if only this node is advertised (0). On RF 
# you likely only want to advertise your own node. On IP, you can send your 
# entire routing table.
#
# The format of this file is:
# axport	min_obs	def_qual	worst_qual	verbose

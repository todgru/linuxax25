AX25 Library
============

This library set is still really under test but is now released for
general use. 

You are supposed to use glibc 2.1 (libc6 unstable libraries) for this
package.  I have attempted to cater for glibc 2.0 users here.

To compile this I used:
  * A Debian GNU/Linux system
  * autoconf 2.69
  * automake 1.11.6
  * libtool 2.4.2
  * libc 2.12
  * gcc 4.7.2

and licensed under the GNU LGPL (see COPYING for more information).

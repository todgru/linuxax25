ax25-tools (1.0.0)
	* This is a custom release, not associated with the official source.
	* This package has been beta for so long, it is time to relase version 1.0.0.
	* Moved axports, nrports, and rsports example config files to this 
	  package from libax25. They should be in here where their associated 
	  utilities reside (kissattach, nrattach, rsattach, etc), not in the 
	  library distribution.
	* Moved the related mans axports.5, nrports.5, and rsports.5 into this 
	  package from libax25. The conf files are here, so the man pages had 
	  to come too.
	* Re-organized the package to put the /etc and /man files in their 
	  own build directories.
	* Put misc README's in /doc
	* Re-checked build dependencies and updated configure.ac for:
	  automake 1.10.1
	  autoconf 2.61
	* Removed un-necessary checks in configure.ac

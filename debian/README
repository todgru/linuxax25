The Debian Package ax25apps
----------------------------

This version is a modified version of the November 2014 GIT source
from http://www.linux-ax25.org/wiki/Main_Page

It re-arranges the source code in to proper directorys, updates to
current autotools, and corrects build dependencies.

Until the modified source makes it into GIT, it will be available
from http://linuxax25.googlecode.com

Package name has been changed froma ax25-apps to ax25apps for better
compatibility with package naming policies.

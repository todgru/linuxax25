ax25-apps (1.0.0)
	* This is a custom release, not associated with the official source.
	* This package has been in beta for so long, it is time to release version 1.0.0.
	* Cleaned up source directories, put the docs, conf files, and mans 
	  in their own folders
	* Rebuilt the configure.ac re-checking dependencies
	* Fixed the configure.ac so the rpm building support works
	* Updated configure to use current GNU autotools
	* Used CVS code (Jan 12 2011) for ax25rtd, ax25mond, call, listen and 
	  used patched source from Bernard Pidoux for ax25ipd
	* ax25ipd now supports:
	   *dynamic DNS hosts (Steve Fraser vk5asf, Jun 2005)
	   *ability to route packets over axip links that are not from the 
	    gateway callsign (Cathryn Mataga)
	   *integrates the dynamic DNS patch and uses mutex and threads
	    if DNS fails on start, route is set to 0 and rechecked about an 
	    hour later (Cathryn Mataga)
	   *ax25ipd.conf now supports additional flags l and p (Cathryn Mataga)
	* ax25ipd should route as before, except in the case when packets 
	  not from the callsign of the route but from the same IP would 
	  have gone to the default route, they now will go to the 
	  ip from which they originate.
	* Default baud rate for ax25ipd is 9600bps. Present version supports 19200
	  and 38400 as well, but any invalid rate will default to 9600. Change compile
	  flags to use TERMIOS instead of TERMIO which is obsolete. (Lee W.)
	* Add support for ax25ipd to use baud rates up to 115200. (Lee W.)
	* Removed previous patch that closes stderr and stdout, not required to use Unix98 
	  pty's. Now we get logging and status again when run as a daemon! (Lee W.)	
	* ax25ipd version incremented (Lee W.)

	    with old kernel-AX25 but need recompile.

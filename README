AX25 Tools
==========
To compile this I used:
  * A Debian GNU/Linux system
  * autoconf 2.61
  * automake 1.10.1
  * libtool 1.5.26
  * libc 2.7
  * gcc 4.3.2

Note that kissattch has changed its command line format slight.  While the
old format will work, the -i option is now, err, not optional.  This was
done to stop the million or so emails we get on linux-hams email list
saying why do people get axports unconfigured even after a kissattach 
command.

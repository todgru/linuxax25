## RPM Binary Packages ##

RPM binary packages have been created for this project for your convenience.

They were build on a clean install of CentOS 6. They should be pretty portable, but there are slight differences between CentOS and Mandriva library names that might cause some grief.

If you are installing on a system other than CentOS, you may need to re-build the RPM's.

This isn't too hard to do, in fact we have outlined the process for you on [building RPM's](RPM_Packages.md) .

You may need to edit the .spec file for your distribution to correct the dependency library names in order to get it to build cleanly.

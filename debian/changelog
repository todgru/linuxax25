libax25 (1.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added versioning to the shared libs to differentiate the ones generated
    by this source.
  * Revert a patch from the linux-ax25.org source to axutils.c (version 1.5) that
    changed the behaviour of the ax25_ntoa function (breaking it). aton should
    only convert the callsign, not modify it. Specifically, if the callsign has
    a -0 SSID, DON'T DROP IT! This breaks existing software that does use -0! If
    some program doesn't like SSID -0, then IT should be modified to drop it or do
    whatever you want. The AX.25 spec says callsigns MUST have an SSID from 0-15.
    The ax25_ntoa function strictly should perform the conversion to ascii, and
    that is it.

AX25 Library
============

This library set is still really under test but is now released for
general use. 

You are supposed to use glibc 2.1 (libc6 unstable libraries) for this
package.  I have attempted to cater for glibc 2.0 users here.

To compile this I used:
  * A Debian GNU/Linux system
  * autoconf 2.61
  * automake 1.10.1
  * libtool 1.5.26
  * libc 2.7
  * gcc 4.3.2

and licensed under the GNU LGPL (see COPYING for more information).
